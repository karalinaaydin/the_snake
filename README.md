# Snake Game

This project is a classic Snake Game, built to run in a simple graphical interface. The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat food, and grow longer without hitting the walls or the snake's own body.

Key Features:
.Smooth Gameplay: The snake moves smoothly around the screen, controlled by the arrow keys.
.Growing Snake: Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, making the game progressively more challenging.
.Score Tracking: The game tracks the player's score, which increases as the snake consumes more food.
.Game Over Condition: The game ends when the snake hits the walls or runs into itself.

Technologies Used:
.Python: Core programming language used to implement the game.
.Pygame: A set of Python modules used for writing video games, providing graphics, sounds, and other game development tools.
